# linter-betty

This package will lint C source files in Atom with
[Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty).

## Installation
You will need to have [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty)
installed on your system before trying to use this package, please follow the
instructions on their site to accomplish this.

After installing `Betty` on your system you can install this package by either searching
for it within Atom's package installation section of the settings or by running the
following command in a terminal:
```ShellSession
apm install linter-betty
```

_As this package only provides a service, you will need something to run it. As
such, the [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) package will be installed
automatically for you if it isn't already installed. This will provide the user interface and run the linter for you._

### Setup
Once the package is installed you may need to specify the path to the `Betty`
executable if Atom is not able to find it automatically. You can do this from
Atom's settings menu or by editing your `~/.atom/config.cson` file (choose Open Your Config in Atom's menu). If editing the file by hand you should modify/create a
section like the following:
```cson
'linter-betty':
  # Betty path. Needs to be the full path to the checkpatch script
  'executablePath': ~/Betty/checkpatch.pl
```
